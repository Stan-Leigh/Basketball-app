# Basketball-app

In this repository, I use Heroku to deploy an app built on streamlit. The app scrapes NBA player data from basketball-reference.com. 

The data gathered is from 1950 to 2019 and includes 29 columns that describe attributes/stats on basketball players.

The deployed web app is live at https://st-basketball-app.herokuapp.com/
